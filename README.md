## Abstract
This study examines the impact of having a small child on women’s income in Vietnam using panel data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) between 2004, 2006, and 2008. By employing a First Difference model, we aim to isolate the effect of motherhood status on income, controlling for age, education, and other factors. Findings suggest mothers experience a 1.5% decrease in income due to motherhood, though this effect is statistically insignificant.

## Introduction
Despite advancements in gender equality, women globally continue to face challenges, including the “motherhood penalty,” where motherhood negatively impacts career and earnings. This phenomenon is underexplored in developing countries like Vietnam, where traditional gender roles are prominent. 

Vietnam’s transition from a planned to a market-oriented economy and shifts in labor dynamics provide a unique context for this study. The objective is to understand how motherhood affects women’s income trajectories in Vietnam using a First Difference model on panel data from the VHLSS.

## Literature Review
The concept of the motherhood penalty is well-documented globally, but limited research focuses on developing countries. Key studies include:
- **Gamboa & Zuluaga (2013)**: Analyzing wage gaps for mothers in Colombia using matching procedures.
- **Cukrowska-Torzewska & Matysiak (2020)**: Meta-analysis showing an average motherhood wage penalty across countries, highlighting policy impact on wage disparities.
  
These studies underscore the importance of localized research, as motherhood penalties vary by country and are influenced by cultural and policy environments.

## Data Structure and Variable Construction
Using VHLSS data for 2004, 2006, and 2008, we created a balanced panel dataset focusing on income, socio-demographics, and motherhood status. Key variables:
- **Dependent Variable**: Log of total income
- **Independent Variable**: Mother of a small child (under age three)
- **Control Variables**: Age, schooling years, marital status, ethnicity, public sector employment status

The panel data construction involved merging individual and household data for consistent tracking across survey years.

## Model Selection and Application
A **First Difference Model** was selected to control for unobserved, time-invariant individual factors. This model allows us to measure income changes within individuals across two points in time, focusing on those who participated in consecutive survey years (2004-2006 and 2006-2008).

### Model Specification
The first-difference equation is:
\[
\Delta Y_{it} = \beta \Delta X_{it} + \Delta \epsilon_{it}
\]
where \( Y_{it} \) is the income of individual \( i \) at time \( t \).

## Results and Findings
Key findings:
- **Motherhood Penalty**: A negative 1.5% effect on income for mothers with small children, but statistically insignificant.
- **Age and Public Sector Employment**: Significant positive effects on income, indicating experience and sectoral stability play crucial roles in wage dynamics.
- **Control Variables**: Schooling, ethnicity, and urban/rural status showed no significant short-term effects on income changes.

These findings suggest that motherhood may not drastically affect income in the short term, possibly due to supportive family networks or flexible work options.

## Conclusion and Policy Implications
### Summary of Findings
The study finds no significant motherhood penalty in Vietnam, though age and public sector employment are notable determinants of income. 

### Policy Implications
To mitigate potential income disparities for mothers, policymakers might consider accessible childcare, flexible work policies, and targeted support for working mothers. 

## Limitations and Future Research
This study was constrained by data inconsistencies and limited longitudinal periods. Future research could leverage more consistent and extended datasets to explore long-term impacts of motherhood on income. Additionally, qualitative studies could provide insight into the challenges faced by mothers in Vietnam’s labor market.
